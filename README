urdl version 0.1
Released Wednesday, 03 June 2009.

See doc/index.html for build information and API documentation.

Added by huebel:
When the url object given to read_stream contains data in its user_info,
an "Autorization: Basic " HTTP header is added with the base64 encoded
user_info data. This makes it usable with HTTP servers requiring basic
authentication.
